# stackative
Stackative is a minimalistic and user-friendly stack-oriented programming language. It stands out with simple syntax and using only stack for data handling.
In Stackative every insctruction is represented by single sing like '?', '!' or '@'. It makes code very compact and small. Insctructions are executed one after another by iterating through the code file. Program behaviour can be modified by loops, if commands etc. There is no goto or break commands, but I consider adding them in further versions of language.
Minimalism of Stackative is well represented in "Hello World!" program which looks like this:

Hello World\!!

In Stackative all data is stored on stack. This makes programs much simplier, because you don't need to declare any variables or data structures. Stack automaticly converts data you put to it to integer or string, so there are no data conversion commands there.
