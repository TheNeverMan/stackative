Comment:
This is much more complicated version of calculator from previous example. This version can calculate on numbers bigger than 9 (more than one digit).
However due to buggy way how zero strings are treated it can't calculate on numbers like 100,200 or 900. 1000 is fine. I will need to refactor and rewrite this
calculator.
